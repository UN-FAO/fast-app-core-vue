### Solution Architecture

Data collection projects have several stages that must be covered to achieve a successful project. All of the stages have their own complexity levels and require a well-defined structure and internal processes to easy the development process of new projects.
The FAST framework considers that at least there should be 5 different teams to cover every stage of the Data Collection process.

1.  APP DEVELOPMENT
2.  SQL, NO-SQL DB MANAGEMENT AND ETL
3.  BIG DATA, BI AND AI
4.  DATA VISUALIZATION
5.  DATA DISSEMINATION

And at least 4 roles working across all centers

1.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND CUSTOMER RELATIONS
2.  QA
3.  SDLC
4.  UI / UX
