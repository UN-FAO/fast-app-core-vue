  'ABOUT FAW',
  'YOU SHOULD NOT PANIC',
  'AT THE SIGN OF FAW IN YOUR FIELD',
  'IMMEDIATE ACTION TO TAKE',
  'Check your fields as soon as seedlings appear and continue at least two times per week until tasselling',
  'Use your fingers to squash any whitish or greyish egg masses (about the size of your thumb) and young larvae (worms) on top and bottom of the leaves',
  'Sprinkling ash, sand or dirt into whorls has been done by some farmers, others use soap or local botanical solutions',
  'Some botanical insecticides (e.g. Neem) and pathogens (virus, bacteria, fungi) known to be effective',
  'Application directly into the whorls of plants that show FAW damage can be very effective',
  'Pheromone traps can be used to help detect the presence, buildup and movement of FAW in your area',
  'CAUTION',
  'Spraying insecticides early in the crop cycle will kill off the natural enemies and may not be economical',
  'Older pesticides may be hazardous to human health and may be banned in other countries',
  'Effectiveness of insecticides against FAW depends on the application technique, dose and formulation',
  'Once FAW is down in the whorl, the insecticides must reach them there',
  'Spraying with backpack sprayers without delivering insecticides directly into the whorl is often ineffective',
  'Spraying insecticides several times can dramatically increase the costs of production, making the maize economically unviable',
  'FAW FACTS',
  'A native of the Americas, FAW is now in Africa to stay',
  'A pest of more than 80 plant species',
  'FAW lives about 35–61 days',
  'Adult females lay eggs directly on maize leaves and hatch in 3–5 days',
  'The larvae (worm or caterpillar) develop in 14–28 days, moving from the leaf to the whorl and sometimes to the maize ear',
  'After development, larvae drop to the ground to pupate in the soil for 7–14 days',
  'The moth appears and lives as an adult for 11–14 days, and can fly up to 100 km per night',
  'FAW can breed continuously, causing several generations per year',
  'In the Americas natural biological control (predators, parasitoids and pathogens) kill up to 50% of FAW in unsprayed maize fields',
  'Planting date is very important – late planted maize gets attacked much more than early-planted maize',
  'Increasing plant diversity (such as intercropping) can reduce FAW oviposition and increase natural enemy populations',
  'The app is to be used every time fields are checked (scouting) and pheromone traps are counted for Fall Armyworm (FAW), Africa Armyworm (AAW) and Stem Borer',
  'The primary target user is the farmer, supplemented by community focal persons, extension agents and plant protection officers when the farmer does not have a smart phone',
  'Relying solely on extension agents or plant protection officers may not give the desired coverage as they are unlikely to be able to visit all farms on a regular and timely basis',
  'The app has three sections: General information, Field scouting and Pheromone traps',
  'Some information is required (indicated by a red asterisk) that must be entered before continuing',
  'The app is multilingual – initially English and French',
  'The app should be used in conjunction with the FAO Guidance Notes on Scouting and Trapping',
  'Data can be transmitted immediately or stored and sent once a connection becomes available',
  'The app allows users to monitor FAW, AAW and Stem Borer',
  'Data from the app provides farmers, communities and countries with early warning and advice on changes in FAW population levels and distribution in order to protect their crops',
  'The app is very intuitive and easy to use – it should take about 10 minutes to learn',
  'FAMEWS was inspired by AWorldBridge (aworldbridge.com) students and developed by FAO IT-Solutions based on their ideas and inputs from affected countries and other partners',
